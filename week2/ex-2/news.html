    <h2>news1</h2>
    <p id="news1">
             We don’t see things as they are, we see them as we are.
            Anais Nin offers a mind-altering phrase here that has the ability to change the way you think of the world. There’s the way things are, and then there’s the way we seem them through the lens that is us. This is why it’s always good to question your perception and see if that’s really how things are.
            
            Works best when you start to think that there’s no way to see things other than the way you see them. Could help diffuse a big argument or even a minor disagreement with someone rather than trying to validate a misperception.

    <h2>news2</h2>
    <p id="news2">
            The past has no power over the present moment.
            Eckhart Tolle’s main thesis is that the past and present don’t exist outside of our own minds, and that all that really matters is right now. He makes the case that now is the only moment you ever have, and that this is your point of power, the point at which anything ever gets done or occurs.
            
            Works best when you feel like the past is sabotaging the present. Realizing that the past exists only in your head, and has no bearing over what is happening now, other than the thoughts you give to it that are causing you to overlook the now moment.
    </p>
    <h2>news3</h2>
    <p id="news3">
             If you wait, all that happens is you get older.
            Larry McMurtry reminds us that there’s never a better time to get started than right now. Waiting just lets time pass by with nothing getting done, and no progress made towards what you really want. Before long you could find yourself out of time and still waiting.
            
            Works best when you’ve been putting off an important decision, project or other undertaking until conditions are “just right”. Chances are that perfect time will never come about, and you’ll have wished you’d started sooner so you could be experiencing the fruits of that decision.      
    </p>
    <h2>news4</h2>
    <p id="news4">
            All journeys have secret destinations of which the traveler is unaware.
            Martin Buber is letting us know that the destination isn’t really that important as long as we’re up for the journey. Discovering places you love that were never on your radar is one of the hidden treasures that happen when you make the choice to venture in the direction of your dreams.
            
            Works best when you feel like you’re not making any headway on reaching your desired destination. It could be that you’re in a destination you didn’t have in mind, and that you’re blind to how great it is just because it isn’t exactly what you wanted.
    </p>
    <h2>news5</h2>
    <p id="news5">
            If opportunity doesn’t knock, build a door.
            Milton Berle shows that it’s necessary to get the right pieces in place or it could be quite awhile before anything can happen. In order to opportunity to knock there needs to be a door first, which means conditions must be right for opportunity to present itself.
            
            Works best when you feel like you’ve been waiting around long enough for opportunity to knock, and it just doesn’t seem to be doing so. Analyze your current situation and see if it is one where opportunity has the ability to knock, and if not get busy building the door for it.

    <h2>news6</h2>
    <p id="news6">
            How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives.
Annie Dillard points out something that most of us intrinsically know, but that is so easy to forget. It’s especially true when we get stuck in a rut and then end up living the result of that rut, and lose sight of the fact that your days will eventually make up your life.

Works best when you’re considering writing off a day due to a bad start, or on the verge of repeating a bad habit that you know won’t help you accomplish what you need to do today. A lifetime consists of a collection of individual days, so it’s best to make the most of each one.

    <h2>news7</h2>
    <p id="news7">
            Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.
            Winston Churchill knew a thing or two about success and here he sums up the key he used to get there. This is a skill that must be learned, as human nature has our emotions linked to the outcome of the things we do and what happens to us.
            
            Works best when you’re reeling from a recent failure and need some motivation to get yourself excited about the next thing on your list. It may sound counterintuitive but you simply have to get excited even though you just failed miserably, and could very well fail again.
